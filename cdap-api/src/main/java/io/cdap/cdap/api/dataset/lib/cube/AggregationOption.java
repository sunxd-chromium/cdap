/**
 * The metrics aggregation option. It provides multiple options to aggregate the metrics:
 * TRUE: if the aggregation is set to TRUE, the metrics query will always use the total resolution table for result,
 *       which means the start and end time are ignored, and the number of data point for any metric name and tags will
 *       be 1.
 * FALSE: if the aggregation is set to FALSE, the metrics query will not do any aggregation on the data points. The
 *        resolution will be determined based on the start and end time, the number of data points returned will be
 *        based on the count specified in the query. If the number of data points > count, the latest data points will
 *        be returned. Else, all the data points will be returned. If no count is specified, all the data points will
 *        be returned.
 * SUM: if the aggregation is set to SUM, the metrics query will partition the number of metrics data points to the
 *      given count. Each partition will get aggregated to the sum of the interval. Depending on whether there is a
 *      remainder R, the first R data points will be discarded. If no count is specified or count is greater than or
 *      equal to the number of data points, all the data points will be returned.
 *      For example, if the metrics query result has 100 data points, and if the count is 10, then each 10 of the data
 *      points will be aggregated to one single point based on the aggregation option. If there are 100 points and the
 *      count is 8, since remainder is 4, first 4 data points will be discarded. The buckets will have
 *      100 / 8 = 12 data points aggregated, with 96 data points in total.
 * LATEST: if the aggregation is set to LATEST, the metrics query will behave similar to SUM. The only difference is
 *         that the data points in the partitioned interval will get aggregated to the last data point.
